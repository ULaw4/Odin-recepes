    <h3>About Spicy Tuna</h3>
    <p>Spicy tuna is a common name for different rolls of sushi with two things in common: the use of tuna, and a spicy sauce. The tuna this roll is diced into small pieces, so the size of the initial block doesn’t matter. So it’s a great solution for odd shape blocks of tuna you might end up having that won’t fit any other roll.</p>
    <h3>Lets start with the sauce</h3>
    <p>What gives the spicy tuna roll its kick is the spicy mayo sauce.  You wouldn’t believe how easy that is to make! The following instructions are for making enough sauce to use in 4 ST rolls. My recommendation is to prepare double that amount and serving the remainder as dipping sauce.</p>
    <p><strong>You will need</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp mayonnaise of your choice (preferably Kewpie)</li>
        <li>1 tsp spicy chilli sauce (recommended Sriracha)</li>
        <li>1 tsp fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sesame oil (Kadoyas).</li>
        <li>200 grams of diced tuna</li>
        <li>100 grams of sushi rice</li>
        <li>algi sheets</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>And just mix it up :)</h3>
    
    <p>You also will need</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>100 grams of sushi rice</li>
        <li>Nori sheets</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Lets Roll :$</h3>
    <p>Get everything ready up on a table.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the Nori on top of the bambo mat</li>
        <li>Place the rice on top of the Nori and spread it, until it covers the netire Nori</li>
        <li>Flip the nori so the rice is facin the mat</li>
        <li>Now place the mix of spicy tuna in a straight line on the midle of the nori</li>
        <li>With the help of the bambo mat <strong>ROLL IT UP</strong></li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Slice it</h3>
    <p>Just slice the roll with a wet knife in equal parts and we are done and the roll its ready to eat. However if you would like we can add toppins on top of the roll, such as: sesame seed, green onion, more spice mayo. Get wild :D</p>
